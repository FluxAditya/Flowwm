# Flowwm

Flowwm aims to:

- Classify packets and flows as benign or malicious with high true positives (TP) and low false positives (FP).
- Use the labeled data to reduce amount of traffic requiring deeper analysis.

Additionally, Deepfence FlowMeter also categorizes packets into flows and shows a rich ensemble of flow data and statistics.
